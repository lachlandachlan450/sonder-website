# Sonder
This is a website for my friend, it should be quite simple
## Bits
So basically what we want the website to have is 
- Description about what the website is
- List of headshots which link to their respective pages
- Pages for each headshot has an audio file, an interview with person in said headshot

## Description
The website is about the feeling of 'sonder', the feeling that you get when you walk past people that look interesting and think, "I wonder what their story is?"
It should have a descriptive paragraph which my friend will write.

## Headshots
I think it'd be good to be able to scroll through the headshots, taken by another friend, each one linking to the interview with the person by the OG friend.

That's all!
